## 📝 Important Note for Android 16 Users

Android 16 introduces **new SMS security rules** and **stricter installation checks**.  
Because SavPay reads transaction SMS (bank/payment messages), Android may show:

- “Unverified App” warning  
- “Unknown App” installation notice  
- “Security Scan” prompt
- If the app is not installed or failed during the installation process, turn off Google Play Protect from settings for a limited time. 

These warnings appear **even though the app is safe**, and do **not** appear on Android 15 and below.

This is a **temporary issue** and will be resolved in an upcoming update.

### ✔ What You Should Do

When installing on Android 16:

- If you see a security scan prompt, tap **Continue / Install Anyway**  
- Only install the APK from our official website:  
  👉 https://sav.com.bd  
- Do **not** download SavPay from third-party websites  

The warning only appears because the APK is sideloaded and uses SMS permissions.

A fully verified release is coming soon.
